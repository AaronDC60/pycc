Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
To install PyCC, you will need a Python environment with the following packages:

* Python 3.8
* Psi4
* NumPy
* opt_einsum

Once you have these packages installed, you can install PyCC in the same environment using::

    pip install -e .

Usage
-----
This is complicated because we need Psi4 to give us key quantities, but soon this page will have
cut-and-paste examples.
